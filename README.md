Hello! I am a full-stack software engineer with hands-on experience in TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, SQL, Angular, Spring Web MVC, React, Next.js, Express, and Django. I design and build scalable APIs, optimize system performance, and implement automated testing for high-quality, maintainable software.

I have a strong track record of improving query execution times, enhancing user experience, and mentoring developers in modern web technologies. My focus is on clean architecture, efficient code, and intuitive user interfaces that deliver real impact.

Open to software development roles, freelance projects, or collaborative opportunities. Flexible on compensation, aligned to the scope and impact of the work.
